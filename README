saugns is the Scriptable AUdio GeNeration System,
the implementation of the SAU (Scriptable AUdio) language.

SAU is a simple language for mathematical sound synthesis,
without support for the use of pre-recorded samples.
While the language is still primitive relative to the
goal (a useful language for writing electronic music),
it makes it simple to experiment with sounds.

A collection of basic wave types are supported, as well as
AM, FM, and PM (the "FM" of most commercial synthesizers).
An arbitrary number of oscillators can be used.

A concise SAU language reference can be found in
the 'doc/README.SAU' file, while example scripts
are under 'examples/'.

The program reads SAU (Scriptable AUdio) files or strings.
Output can be to system audio, and/or a 16-bit PCM WAV file.

Supported platforms include x86 and x86-64,
running DragonFly, FreeBSD, Linux, NetBSD, or OpenBSD.
Other systems are untested. The following audio systems are expected:
	DragonFly	OSS
	FreeBSD  	OSS
	Linux    	ALSA or OSS
	NetBSD   	OSS
	OpenBSD  	sndio

Usage information is provided by running it without arguments,
or the saugns(1) man page after installing.

Building and installing
=======================

Building requires a C99 compiler toolchain and
running `make` (GNU or BSD). (There is no "configure" step.)

On Linux systems, the ALSA library (libasound2) must first be installed.
In the cases of the 4 major BSDs, the base systems have it all.

A simple test after building is the following, which should
play a sine wave at 444Hz for 1 second:
	./saugns -e "Osin"

`make install` will by default copy 'saugns' to '/usr/local/bin/',
and the contents of 'doc/' and 'examples/' to
directories under '/usr/local/share/':
	'doc/saugns/README.SAU' 	SAU language reference.
	'examples/saugns/' 		Example and test scripts.
(`make uninstall` removes the saugns binary and share directories.)

After installation, the saugns(1) man page gives
basic usage information and points to these files.
